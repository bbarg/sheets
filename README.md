## Pressing Questions

- **Translator**: When do we deal with semantic checking?
  + Currently, we are pushing most semantic checking to `gcc`. That
    will be really weird for users trying to debug stuff like name
    redefinition and stuff. Is there ANY way to map this stuff back to
    our sheets compiler.
